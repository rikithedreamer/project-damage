Description             : A single-player/coop map pack to celebrate 25
                          years of DOOM. Techbases, monuments to evil,
                          demonic ambushes, even the occasional
                          Wolfenstein Nazis: this is classic DOOM
                          action.
                          
                          This map pack should work with many different
                          mods in GZDoom as well as other source ports
                          as well. Try it with your favorite mod!
